#### This plugin simplifies plugin development for those wanting to make tools for the Godot Editor.

**It adds this to the main toolbar in the top-right Corner :**

1. A dropdown menu to easily select a **`Plugin`**.

2. A **`CheckBox`** to toggle **`Plugin`** ON/OFF and to shows you if it's enabled or disabled.

3. A **`Refresh`** Button to toggle it off then on.

#### It saves you from:

1. Click **`Project Settings`** from **`Project`** menu.

2. Go to **`Plugins`** tab (first time).

3. Find the desired plugin.

4. Check if it's enabled/disabled or to enable/disable it.

5. Close the Project Settings.

6. Edit your plugin script.

7. Repeat this process again !
